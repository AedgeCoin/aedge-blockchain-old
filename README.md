Aedge means algorithmic edge.

Aedge is creating a decentralized ecosystem that enables users to exchange the value of any asset using the market value of AedgeCoin. Based on the [Chia Network](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain) codebase, AedgeCoin (AEC) is compatible with Chia plots and parallel/multi-fork farming.

Aedge follows the same emission schedule as Chia, but differs in the prefarm. Chia has a prefarm of 21M (as a homage to to Bitcoin) that will be surpassed after 20 years by Chia emission. Aedge adopts a startup methodology of 5+1 years worth of prefarm (or â‰ˆ15M) based on the statistical fact that 90% of most startups (probably crypto projects too) fail, and the first 5 years of a startups life is the most critical. This also means that assuming no prefarm is utilized, the number of AEC coins generated through farming would reach parity with the prefarm and become the majority in 6 years, in tandem with the maturing of AedgeCoin's ecosystem.
